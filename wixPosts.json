Following our 10th Annual Adopt-A-Family celebration last December 2023, we hosted a series of events for our CIMI community. In the Spring, we held our annual Kick Off celebration to welcome and greet new families to our program. In the summer, we hosted a Back-To-School event to prepare our youth towards a new school year. Then for the first time ever, this fall, we provided scholarships to deserving first-generation college students. These events were made possible by the support of our amazing donors who helped CIMI raise $40,000 in donations in 2023 and $21,000 so far in 2024.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<hr />\n<p></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0)\">10th Annual Adopt-A-Family</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(102, 102, 102)\">December 18, 2023</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0)\">Our 10th Annual Adopt-A-Family event was a huge success! The CIMI community and donarship gathered for a fun-filled afternoon complete with holiday festivities, delicious food and even a photobooth. As always, our signature event began with a walking activity around the track to reinforce our values of building physical strength through exercise and community. Our event ended with our donors adopting their families and providing them with holiday gift cards. We were very proud to see our members commemorate the activities of the year, but also to see their growth and confidence building. For the first time, CIMI moms and daughters each made a presentation to the audience naming reasons why they are proud to be CIMI members and ways that CIMI has helped them grow mentally and physically. Amongst the reasons mentioned, is learning the value of community that CIMI provides.

To start, our amazing CIMI Moms (Rosario, Tania, Janeth, and Maria V.) arrived at 6:45 am to prepare the space, lay out breakfast items, and to decorate with our signature CIMI flags. Thirty-one families arrived shortly after and began the morning with a walk around the neighborhood. Following the walk, our CIMI founder, Aracely Areas, welcomed members old and new to share information about the upcoming events for the year. CIMI also provided gift cards which were much appreciated.  Everyone was excited to kick off 2024!</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_11960eef8a8441febba51c24fc6c23cd~mv2.png\" alt=\"Families at the Kick-Off event \"/>\n<hr />\n<p></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0)\">Back-to-School</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(102, 102, 102)\">September 10, 2024</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0)\">Our back-to-school event was held at Santa Maria Urban Ministry.

Afterwards, 39 families received back-to school bags for the upcoming school year. All the families were grateful for the support they received that day.  </span></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_055be7873c5e4efa8a6c68df81a5d83b~mv2.jpeg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_539a2e9b8b374e0ca6f7cb7688d3d1ad~mv2.jpeg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_48b1648f6922426085b6e8617a98b3c8~mv2.jpeg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_dd352da6f1e9488eb177801d75317394~mv2.jpeg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_0591f0bf10f448a59882086e12566882~mv2.jpeg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_9e7091e437d6418494e7f85a45390ec0~mv2.jpeg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /></div>\n<p></p>\n<hr />\n<p></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0)\">Scholarship Awarding Ceremony </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(102, 102, 102)\">October 6, 2024 </span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0)\">A new initiative this year was to offer scholarships to college students.

While we expected entries from younger scholars, our first recipient spoke about attending college online while being in her late thirties and as a mother of three. She takes online classes in the evenings and shared how challenging it is to juggle motherhood and school. She said she knows this is the best path for her future as a social worker, and was awarded $1500. Our second recipient also received $1500 to attend college. She is a first generation college student, originally from Mexico, and is pursuing an education and degree in Nursing. Finally, our third honoree had once been part of our Girls-Who-Code program and earned the largest scholarship amount: $2000. She discussed her plans of majoring in criminology. </span></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_cd6ac4ef9f314c749ed55338d9d37b8a~mv2.jpg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_f4b1ab9acb3c4f7bbdc664a24686dea5~mv2.jpg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_748e964ea97d4e678d4e36aaf0a36d3c~mv2.jpg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /></div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #797770\">Our three scholarship winners</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<hr />\n<p></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0)\">What’s Next </span></h2>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0)\">Our year in review has been eventful for our CIMI community.

We are excited for more food, merriment, and cheer and for our donarship to once again sponsor their families. This year, we are excited to feature Sherry Heinz, a recurring donor, who has already donated $10,000 to the event! We welcome any donations, volunteers, and any member referrals to our program. We thrive on building our community through physical exercise in order to be mentally strong for the growth of our membership.

As the families walked, the organizers of the event set up bagels, pan dulce, champurrado, coffee, and prepared for the raffle. The families were were awarded water bottles, and other raffle prizes. Present were also the original six Girls Who Code. In 2023, they will graduate from the coding program having learned Python.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_ef9ec22d513e4d0e82cf52ea723cfddc~mv2.jpg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_4ad74979a52148b68fa396919f9bd760~mv2.jpg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_c8ed51e8ee1c47cebaa551ee7d909f18~mv2.jpg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_d25ec7583bfb41b9a35b528deeffb1c2~mv2.jpg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_6e095a4792404ff79112fb55efbf5503~mv2.jpg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_d39b47ec23c442ed967de136e4ef75c4~mv2.jpg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_353f2d584494440f97e26fba69da564e~mv2.jpg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_5016f663a2894b7db4cebdc8fd767938~mv2.jpg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_52dd370d4991412f921a874479ff336e~mv2.jpg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /></div>\n<p>View the slideshow to see pictures from the event! </p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Rules of the program </h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>This year, CIMI has implemented new rules for activity tracking to indicate membership. As part of the kickoff event, families received help setting up their Strava accounts and the organizers went over the rules of the program. Families are encouraged to log a minimum of 20 minutes of walking or running activity, three times a week. The breakdown is as follows: </p>\n<ul><li><p>Priority 1: Log minimum activity (as described above) for 50-52 weeks in 2023</p></li><li><p>Priority 2: Log minimum activity for 40-49 weeks </p></li><li><p>Priority 3: Log minimum activity for 30-38 weeks </p></li><li><p>Priority 4: Log minimum activity for <30 weeks </p></li></ul>\n<p>Activity tracking for membership will help CIMI set a priority for give-aways (especially for our 2023 holiday event). The families were excited to learn the new rules, and kept the organizers on their toes with engaging questions. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em><strong>Question: What if we travel outside of the country? </strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Answer: </strong>You can still log activity outside of the country because your Strava should still be active. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em><strong>Question: Can we log 60 minutes once a week for that week to be counted?</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Logging activity once a week (even 60 minutes of activity) is great exercise for you, but in order for that week to count, you must have logged a minimum of 20 minutes, 3 times a week.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_424efaef0bad4675b6cec6f52de37ce2~mv2.jpg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /></div>\n<p>CEO Aracely Areas announcing the rules of the program</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>What’s in Store in 2023?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>CIMI is excited to announce exciting programs in 2023! The next installment of Girls Who Code launched on February 25th. We introduced two new instructors to the program: Soliana Seyoum and Krishna Dave. Soliana and Krishna work as software engineers and are helping take our Girls Who Code program to a new level! </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here is a glimpse of other program initiatives in 2023: A 0-5K program will launch providing families the opportunity to run their first 5k! We will continue our program teaching moms computer basics and our volleyball summer program to encourage our CIMI youth to pursue sporting activities at school. Now that CIMI’s mission has grown, we will also have website revamp and rebranding to encompass the education endeavors that CIMI is tackling. 2023 here we come! </p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_c8b4b3c576d74ab69de78a4e3bdb335d~mv2.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n<p>CIMI, Inc.</p>\n<p>P.O.

But the one I liked since the beginning was volleyball. I was already playing volleyball at school but it was not enough. Thanks to CIMI I was able to learn more, get feedback on my performance, and get used to it again. I learned how to spike and do the overhand serve. It was hard at first but I kept trying. What I enjoyed the most was the activities we did during beach and indoor volleyball because we combined everything we learned and put it to the test. Also we were able to see how the professionals play it. Thanks to these volleyball classes I was able to remember the moves I used to do. It will be amazing that we have the chance to do volleyball again or a different sport.</em> <strong>-Amy</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Dear CIMI,</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to try out volleyball.  Without your help this summer would have been boring. Because of your helpI’ll be going into this school year learning more stuff about volleyball which will help me a lot for tryouts. I’m glad that I did volleyball this summer because now I have new friends. I also learned a lot of new skills which I’ll be using.

Since there were a lot of us at the time, we helped each other and built a robot at the end of the first module . </em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>There were 7 girls left at the second module. Again we helped each other finish the second module. </em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>The third module didn’t have as many girls in the beginning, but we still worked hard and had fun together. There were 5 girls and I was one of them. It took me a while to understand the third module (swift), but with some teamwork we finished our last module. Coding was a bit hard and when I started the third module. I kept getting behind everyone and I always got confused, but with some help from my classmates and teachers I got an idea of how it works but I still have problems typing the code to make the character move.</em></p>\n<p><em>T</em></p>\n<p><em>hank you CIMI for providing coding classes for us. I appreciate all the teachers – Ms.Brenda, Ms.Ivonne, and Josh. They have helped me a lot. </em><strong>-Fernanda</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Coding Experience</em></p>\n<p><em>At the beginning I did not know anything about coding – how it worked, why it worked that way, and the structure it is coded in. But when I started coding I started to learn different things like getting to know how the computer works and its language. </em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>I made some mistakes on the way but when I analyzed it I was able to figure it out, sometimes it was because I spelled something wrong or because I missed a part of code or put the wrong word of code. </em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Scratch was easy but when we started with Swift I felt that the real challenge had come. And I was right. But, with every class I learned new things and how they worked. We even made our own virtual assistant app. That was another challenge because we had to change the code we had already done and add new things or replace some parts of the code. </em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Overall I loved coding because I was able to make some code and test how it might work if someone was actually using it. Now that I will be entering 8th grade it might come in handy to use my coding for some classes I have at my school. Like Game design, robotics, and multimedia and in these classes some code is needed. </em><strong>-Amy</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Hydraulic Claw Project</em></p>\n<p><em>This project is made for plumbing water through multiple tubes all ink at once. In real life this is called a control panel. There are many different ways but I chose the water one. This robot is connected to things that go way back in the past to be used in the future. From this, I learned never to give up. It really challenged me to not give up because at first I had no idea what this was. I’m glad I didn’t because this turned out amazing and I learned a new robot. I'm happy to show off my new robot to the world!</em> <strong>-Perla Leon</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Project Experience (Desktop Cork Board)</em></p>\n<p><em>Today, each of us got our own kit at random. We had around 2 hours to build it. I got the kit to make a desktop cork board. </em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>I used washi tape, paint, brushes, wood easel, wood stand, wood push pins, word balloon notes, masking stickers, fabric strip, cork piece, sticky foam, and tape hinge. </em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>The first steps were easy like putting the tape to make the design, painting, painting the wood push pins even though I poked myself. The trickiest part was putting the wood easel and the wood stand together because I had to put half of the tape hinge on the wood stand. It took me a while to figure it out but I figured out how to do it by using the line that divided the tape hinge. Later it was to put the sticky foam on the other end of the fabric piece after it was put through the hole. </em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>At the end it came out good. I did my own design of paint and worked on it by myself. This cork board will help me to remind me of the events coming up. I learned that some things are harder than the others and that not everything will come out on the first try. Also I learned how to use a cork board to help me remind me of things and how to build the structure of the cork board with a few simple materials.</em> <strong>-Amy</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Computer Training for Moms</h2>\n<p>Once a month, while the girls met in person at the Camden Community Center to work on their assignments, their moms got to learn basic computer skills.</p>\n<p>  </p>\n<p>For those who work in the tech industry, it’s easy to forget that basic computer skills can be an impediment to those who did not grow up with technology. The basic computer skills were taught in a friendly, hands-on session led by a CIMI board member Kamille. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Moms also participated on a morning walk and learned injury prevention tips from our board Member president Aracely.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Huge “thanks” to our Volunteers: Rosario Jiminez, Paty Lozano, Tania  Brito, Janeth Garcia and Maria Villicana. They are our core volunteers, helping organize all CIMI events.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here’s what the moms said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Today I had my first computer class, and I learned how to create a new email account, how to add my emails to my contacts and how to learn and turn off a computer. thanks for the class. </em><strong>-Janeth Garcia</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Hey! I learned how to use the computer. I learned how to turn off a computer, how to program my calendar, how to create new emails and how to add new contacts.</em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Today I learned how to have a better posture and I also learned how to write and put dates, days, and miles walked per week on Strava and send to Rosario and how you use google doc thanks to Camille for teaching us this is something new for me I hope to learn more thanks. </em><em><strong>-</strong></em><strong>Maria Villicana</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Good afternoon, </em></p>\n<p><em>Today on this beautiful day I learned many wonderful things.!!! For example, how to have a correct posture for the benefit of our back, Thanks to Mrs. Aracely!!! Also how to use the spreadsheet, to keep track of my walks, thus making our leader Rosario's work easier.

Thanks to teacher Kamille Shan and Mrs. Aracely for their time and support in these classes.</em> <strong>-Janeth Garcia</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The result of the most recent training? The moms created their own recipes using a Google Docs template! They now know how to create a document, edit the content and add photos as well as sharing the document with different access levels. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Recipes from CIMI Moms</h3>\n\n<h2>Gasoline Gift Cards</h2>\n<p>CIMI gave gasoline gift cards to families to fight inflation.

Module 2 Scratch began on June 7th as a weekly online class. The module finished in late July in a bootcamp style in-person workshop over two weekends. The Boot Camp was held on July 17 and 24 at the Campbell Community Center since in-person gathering restrictions for COVID lifted. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Module 3 Swift began on September 13. Swift is a general purpose programming language. It is designed to make writing and maintaining correct programs easier for the developer. Learning this safe, fast, and expressive language gives the girls an inspiration into their potential future. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>🎉 Congratulations to the 9 girls who completed Module 3!</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here are some scenes of the girls and volunteers from the bootcamp:</p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_65975f14cce34494a29923fb23d1eaba~mv2.jpeg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_f604400527a64a03b0060ed19e6e9774~mv2.png\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_30ce9a747af64a31b25858dfc61df6ff~mv2.png\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_8093f4efd3a24f6ba53b44770a9a8c2c~mv2.png\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_3cc6f5964bc74a288f42799e3d21151c~mv2.png\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_aa8531a1602f44f7a538b7f39e8cde47~mv2.png\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_316752a3784d46c1935d2d072ad0bb41~mv2.png\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_6176e8feb3b54d4d9b89fe0a13138552~mv2.png\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_9c4dc1f4e78b4870a41a54f250394d36~mv2.jpeg\" alt=\"Gallery image\" /></div>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_0bfe8c7e2a344e01b26b247d416e8ce7~mv2.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n<p><em>Good afternoon, I'm Amy's mother, I thank you for this day.

A few regular volunteers led the breakout room sessions where the girls did reading and activities that reinforced the learnings from the class.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Learning coding concepts like conditionals, functions, and algorithms (amongst others) may sound difficult and dry, but the sessions were fun and relatable! Here is a glimpse from one of the sessions:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong>Sandwich making Activity</strong></span></h2>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_7be867883bfd463b9c09049296a3b57f~mv2.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/77c0fc_d324ea82701e4fe4929951c34adf1acb~mv2.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Girls wrote instructions for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. A volunteer setup his kitchen to make the sandwich. He followed the instructions from the girls as a robot would.

The COVID-19 pandemic made the lives of the underserved families, who were already struggling to make ends meet, very difficult. The service jobs disappeared as restaurants shut down. Children lacking technology access and parental guidance for their school work struggled with distance learning. The sponsors for the Family Sponsor Drive met the challenge by going above and beyond last year’s generous gift. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The socially-distanced gift presentation event took place on the mornings of December 17 and 19 at the Brenda Lopez Memorial Plaza in San Jose, California. CIMI organized this event to make the gift presentation interaction as safe as possible for the families and the volunteers. The families were scheduled to drive by the pick-up site in 15-minute increments. The sponsors and volunteers wearing masks and face shields handed the gifts through the car window. Hand sanitizers were used after each interaction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><strong>A Glimpse into the Life of a Sponsored Family</strong></h2>\n<p>One of Paty’s daughters attended CIMI’s Coding and Robotics program one year ago. The instructors and CIMI volunteers could see that she had talent for coding. Her thirst for knowledge was fueled by her mother, Paty.\n \nPaty believes that that only way to get out of the hole is education. A few years ago, she was interviewed by a local newspaper that was writing an inspirational story of how a mother in an underserved community managed to keep the family together and held the children to high academic standards. It is a big task for a mother of eight children, where one daughter attends Santa Clara University on full scholarship and another daughter attends Notre Dame High School, a private school, also on full scholarship. Other children in elementary and middle schools have excellent grades. Having all eight children excel in their studies is a huge accomplishment for Paty, but it comes with struggles behind the scenes. \n \nPaty’s daughter Maria  did not have a computer to use for her classes so the school provided her with an old one. The school computer was slow and her classmates were complaining that she was taking too long. Maria cried and told her mother of her difficulties. Paty begged her husband to buy a new computer for their daughter. He said, “No, there is no money.” Then Paty went to her brother and convinced him to buy a computer on credit. This allowed Maria to be efficient in her assignments and keep up with her classmates.\n \nIn December 2020, Paty received gift cards from CIMI’s Sponsor a Family Holiday Drive. This allowed her to buy the much-needed computer accessories such as computer charger and headphones for her children. Other families sponsored by CIMI have their own stories. We are grateful for the generous sponsors and donors who made a difficult Christmas during a pandemic just a bit brighter for these families.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>CIMI raised a total of <strong>$70,000</strong> through this drive, of which $33,000 was used for this event. The number of families participating in CIMI programs has grown over the years due to the generosity of our donors. 55 families representing 236 members received Visa, Target, or Home Depot gift cards during this event. CIMI volunteers organized the gift purchases and connected the sponsors with the families.  The balance of $37,000 will be used to fund the CIMI Coding/Robotics, Run/Walk and Sponsor a Family programs in 2021.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The number of families participating in CIMI programs has grown over the years due to the generosity of our donors.  A majority of the sponsored families participated in the CIMI programs in 2020:  80% of them participated in the Run/Walk program with their entire family for health and fitness; and 10% of them participated in the Tutoring program to help the children with distance learning.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In past years, prior to the COVID crisis, CIMI has held a luncheon and party for the sponsors and families at the Campbell Community Center to present gifts to the families. The sponsors and families got to interact with each other as they shared a wonderfully prepared meal by the families. We look forward to when we can have such a party again!

The struggle was greater for parents in the CIMI program because their limited English skills prevented them from helping their children with the online video classes published by San Jose Unified School District. The children were frustrated at home, unable to do the assignments. These elementary school and middle school students were in a household where Spanish was the primary language and 40% of them did not have a computer. About 25% of them had neither a computer nor an iPhone. These students needed help with math, reading, comprehension, and writing.</strong></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong>Volunteers from CIMI stepped up to tutor these students during the month of May.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong>CIMI organized a tutoring program for these students. CIMI parents signed up their children for 1:1 tutoring sessions by listing their needs and availability on an online form. Volunteers chose students from the list then contacted the parents to introduce themselves and to further clarify the needs of the students. Once mutual agreement was established, the tutors worked with the students. Half of the tutors spoke Spanish, the other half conversed with the children in English.</strong></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong>We received positive feedback from tutors and students.
