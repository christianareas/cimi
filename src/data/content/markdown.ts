		"history-of-cimi":
			"## History of CIMI\n\n**CIMI was founded in 2012 by Aracely Areas**, a software professional with a passion for education and exercise. Aracely originally formed CIMI (“Carrera Internacional de la Mujer Iniciativa” or the “international women’s race initiative”) to organize races and give free entry to women from underserved communities in her home country of Nicaragua. As CIMI grew, Aracely sought to find more ways to positively impact the lives of women of all ages. Today, CIMI serves Latina women and their families across the San Jose area by offering a variety of programs to support physical, mental, educational, and community well-being.\n",
		intro:
			"## CIMI's Mission\n\nCIMI’s mission is to **empower** women of all ages to become stronger mentally and physically, **equip** them with necessary technology skills to enter a changing workforce, and **inspire** participants through engaging programs that promote self-esteem and education.\n",
		milestones: {
			"1": "### The first CIMI-sponsored race was held in 2013 in Nicaragua.\n\nOver 250 people participated—many of them women who were running for the first time. After completing her first 5k, one woman commented “I never thought I would be able to do something like this.”\n",
			"2": "## CIMI began a community support program called Adopt-a-Family\n\nDonors are matched to a family they support during the holidays. \n",
			"3": "## In early 2017, the 5th annual CIMI Nicaragua 5k race took place. \n\nThe event drew nearly 900 runners and 70% of them were women. Races also expanded in San Jose, in addition to educational opportunities. \n",
			"4": "## CIMI started an initiative to provide technology to girls in need.\n\nIn partnership with the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, CIMI created the Design_Code_Bootcamp at the Computer History Museum to provide girls in grades 6 through 8 with an opportunity to participate in engaging, hands-on STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, math) workshops.\n",
			"5": "## CIMI sponsored 10 girls to participate in a Google Robotics workshop. \n\nComing from underserved communities, these girls were able to participate in the Girl Powered VEX Robotics Workshop at the Google Event Center. They learned about designing, building, and programming robots in a sold-out event with 550 participants.\n",
			"6": "## CIMI pivoted to virtual when COVID-19 hit. \n\nWhile COVID-19 paused large gatherings like races, CIMI   continued their community-centered programs like gas card giveaways and school supply donations and focus on educational programs.\n",
			"7": "## CIMI’s impact continues to grow. \n\nThe organization now offers physical activities—like volleyball skills workshops, runs, and trail walks—which helps participants gain confidence, manage stress, and build healthy habits. CIMI also offers education programs like coding bootcamps, computer basics classes, robotics, and public speaking opportunities.\n",
