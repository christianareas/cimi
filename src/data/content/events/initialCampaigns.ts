Families in the CIMI program were already struggling before COVID-19 drastically affected the economy. A recent poll showed them to be in good health. Less than half of the families have their children in summer school. The fathers of the families, often the sole bread-winner, are working anywhere from 20 to 40 hours a week.

			"COVID-19 Relief Fund Helping CIMI Families During Pandemic -- June 19, 2020 COVID-19 has struck some groups harder than others. Families in the CIMI program were already struggling before COVID-19 drastically affected the economy. A recent poll showed them to be in good health. Less than half of the families have their children in summer school. The fathers of the families, often the sole bread-winner, are working anywhere from 20 to 40 hours a week. About 60% of the families receive assistance with food. There were few families who had received no help, until they received a COVID-19 relief check from CIMI. In May 2020 CIMI&rsquo;s board of directors approved to send a total of $5,000 from their unrestricted funds to these families. The families appreciated this financial support and used the money to pay for food, utilities, rent, and clothing. In this newsletter, we bring you a glimpse of their life through the stories they have shared with CIMI.",

The kits were pre-labeled with the student names. Volunteers handed out the back-to-school kits when recipients gave their names and standing safe distance away. Some students received Performance-based rewards. CIMI awarded the top 15 students who had the best scores in the CIMI Run/Walk program with noise canceling headsets. This will help them concentrate on their school work during distance learning. Congratulations to those students who focused on both their mental and physical health in consistently walking with their family members this summer. You can check out our video here:",

The COVID-19 pandemic made the lives of the underserved families, who were already struggling to make ends meet, very difficult. The service jobs disappeared as restaurants shut down. Children lacking technology access and parental guidance for their school work struggled with distance learning. The sponsors for the Family Sponsor Drive met the challenge by going above and beyond last year&rsquo;s generous gift.</p>\n<p>The socially-distanced gift presentation event took place on the mornings of December 17 and 19 at the Brenda Lopez Memorial Plaza in San Jose, California. CIMI organized this event to make the gift presentation interaction as safe as possible for the families and the volunteers. The families were scheduled to drive by the pick-up site in 15-minute increments. The sponsors and volunteers wearing masks and face shields handed the gifts through the car window. Hand sanitizers were used after each interaction.</p>\n<h2><strong>A Glimpse into the Life of a Sponsored Family</strong></h2>\n<p>One of Paty&rsquo;s daughters attended CIMI&rsquo;s Coding and Robotics program one year ago. The instructors and CIMI volunteers could see that she had talent for coding. Her thirst for knowledge was fueled by her mother, Paty. Paty believes that that only way to get out of the hole is education. A few years ago, she was interviewed by a local newspaper that was writing an inspirational story of how a mother in an underserved community managed to keep the family together and held the children to high academic standards. It is a big task for a mother of eight children, where one daughter attends Santa Clara University on full scholarship and another daughter attends Notre Dame High School, a private school, also on full scholarship. Other children in elementary and middle schools have excellent grades. Having all eight children excel in their studies is a huge accomplishment for Paty, but it comes with struggles behind the scenes. Paty&rsquo;s daughter Maria did not have a computer to use for her classes so the school provided her with an old one. The school computer was slow and her classmates were complaining that she was taking too long. Maria cried and told her mother of her difficulties. Paty begged her husband to buy a new computer for their daughter. He said, &ldquo;No, there is no money.&rdquo; Then Paty went to her brother and convinced him to buy a computer on credit. This allowed Maria to be efficient in her assignments and keep up with her classmates. In December 2020, Paty received gift cards from CIMI&rsquo;s Sponsor a Family Holiday Drive. This allowed her to buy the much-needed computer accessories such as computer charger and headphones for her children. Other families sponsored by CIMI have their own stories. We are grateful for the generous sponsors and donors who made a difficult Christmas during a pandemic just a bit brighter for these families.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>CIMI raised a total of <strong>$70,000</strong> through this drive, of which $33,000 was used for this event. The number of families participating in CIMI programs has grown over the years due to the generosity of our donors. 55 families representing 236 members received Visa, Target, or Home Depot gift cards during this event. CIMI volunteers organized the gift purchases and connected the sponsors with the families. The balance of $37,000 will be used to fund the CIMI Coding/Robotics, Run/Walk and Sponsor a Family programs in 2021.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The number of families participating in CIMI programs has grown over the years due to the generosity of our donors.

			"Virtual Run/Walk Challenge Computers for Girls Coding Program in an Underserved Community January 18, 2021 CIMI&rsquo;s Virtual Run/Walk Challenge inspired people to get moving (run, walk, or bike) after the smoke from the wildfires thinned out. Participants chose a challenge distance of 5k, 10k, or half marathon during the month of November 2020 to show their commitment to their own fitness. Members of the CIMI sponsored families received a backpack with household supplies such as hand sanitizers and water bottles. CIMI supporters and members of the public also participated in this challenge. Thanks to your active participation, CIMI raised over $22,000 from this event. The proceeds will be used to support an upcoming program, CIMI Coding Class for Girls, that leverage tools from another nonprofit organization, Girls Who Code (GWC). They are building a pipeline of female engineers to close the gender gap in computing. They have served 300,000 girls around the world. Half of the girls they have served come from historically underrepresented groups, including, girls who are Black, Latinx, or from low-income backgrounds. CIMI has signed up girls in elementary and middle schools from underserved communities in San Jose who are eager to learn coding. The program is structured to deliver four modules created by GWC. Each module is 10-weeks long and delivered via virtual platform. GWC will provide the course materials and CIMI will provide the computers and the online learning environment. CIMI is working closely with a facilitator to launch this program in March 2020. The modules are: Learning the Basics Scratch Swift (on iPad) Python In addition to the tutorials (independent working time, code collaboration, code alongs, or pair programming), each session is organized and facilitated to build bravery and confidence. The girls will also receive a certificate for their participation and will be able to start building their resumes. The program also spotlights women flourishing in the field of technology. Introducing our Facilitator: Ivonne Figueroa Ivonne Figueroa believes education is the most powerful equalizer.

But the one I liked since the beginning was volleyball. I was already playing volleyball at school but it was not enough. Thanks to CIMI I was able to learn more, get feedback on my performance, and get used to it again. I learned how to spike and do the overhand serve. It was hard at first but I kept trying. What I enjoyed the most was the activities we did during beach and indoor volleyball because we combined everything we learned and put it to the test. Also we were able to see how the professionals play it. Thanks to these volleyball classes I was able to remember the moves I used to do. It will be amazing that we have the chance to do volleyball again or a different sport.</em> <strong>-Amy</strong></p>\n<p><em>Dear CIMI,</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to try out volleyball. Without your help this summer would have been boring. Because of your helpI&rsquo;ll be going into this school year learning more stuff about volleyball which will help me a lot for tryouts. I&rsquo;m glad that I did volleyball this summer because now I have new friends. I also learned a lot of new skills which I&rsquo;ll be using. Thank you CIMI for giving me this opportunity to try out volleyball because without this my summer would not be the same.</em> <strong>-Perla Leon</strong></p>\n<h2>Coding and Robotics Camp</h2>\n<p>The weekly Coding Camp was focused on completing the SWIFT module.

I appreciate all the teachers &ndash; Ms.Brenda, Ms.Ivonne, and Josh. They have helped me a lot. </em><strong>-Fernanda</strong></p>\n<p><em>Coding Experience</em></p>\n<p><em>At the beginning I did not know anything about coding &ndash; how it worked, why it worked that way, and the structure it is coded in. But when I started coding I started to learn different things like getting to know how the computer works and its language. </em></p>\n<p><em>I made some mistakes on the way but when I analyzed it I was able to figure it out, sometimes it was because I spelled something wrong or because I missed a part of code or put the wrong word of code.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>Scratch was easy but when we started with Swift I felt that the real challenge had come. And I was right. But, with every class I learned new things and how they worked. We even made our own virtual assistant app. That was another challenge because we had to change the code we had already done and add new things or replace some parts of the code.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>Overall I loved coding because I was able to make some code and test how it might work if someone was actually using it. Now that I will be entering 8th grade it might come in handy to use my coding for some classes I have at my school. Like Game design, robotics, and multimedia and in these classes some code is needed.&nbsp;</em><strong>-Amy</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Hydraulic Claw Project</em></p>\n<p><em>This project is made for plumbing water through multiple tubes all ink at once. In real life this is called a control panel. There are many different ways but I chose the water one. This robot is connected to things that go way back in the past to be used in the future. From this, I learned never to give up. It really challenged me to not give up because at first I had no idea what this was. I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t because this turned out amazing and I learned a new robot. I\'m happy to show off my new robot to the world!</em> <strong>-Perla Leon</strong></p>\n<p><em>Project Experience (Desktop Cork Board)</em></p>\n<p><em>Today, each of us got our own kit at random. We had around 2 hours to build it. I got the kit to make a desktop cork board.</em></p>\n<p><em>I used washi tape, paint, brushes, wood easel, wood stand, wood push pins, word balloon notes, masking stickers, fabric strip, cork piece, sticky foam, and tape hinge. </em></p>\n<p><em>The first steps were easy like putting the tape to make the design, painting, painting the wood push pins even though I poked myself. The trickiest part was putting the wood easel and the wood stand together because I had to put half of the tape hinge on the wood stand. It took me a while to figure it out but I figured out how to do it by using the line that divided the tape hinge. Later it was to put the sticky foam on the other end of the fabric piece after it was put through the hole.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>At the end it came out good. I did my own design of paint and worked on it by myself. This cork board will help me to remind me of the events coming up. I learned that some things are harder than the others and that not everything will come out on the first try. Also I learned how to use a cork board to help me remind me of things and how to build the structure of the cork board with a few simple materials.</em> <strong>-Amy</strong></p>\n<h2>Computer Training for Moms</h2>\n<p>Once a month, while the girls met in person at the Camden Community Center to work on their assignments, their moms got to learn basic computer skills.</p>\n<p>For those who work in the tech industry, it&rsquo;s easy to forget that basic computer skills can be an impediment to those who did not grow up with technology.

			"Coding, Volleyball, Computer Basics, &amp; Gas Gift Cards August 2022 The CIMI girls and their moms had a busy schedule this summer! 2 &frac12; hours Instructor-led coding camp via Zoom Beach Volleyball Camp Volleyball Skills Camp Meet in person - Coding Camp for girls and Basic Computer Skills for moms Volleyball The girls in the CIMI coding program were motivated to upgrade their volleyball skills. Volleyball is a popular team sport in middle schools and it is a competitive sport. Many who try out for the sport don&rsquo;t make the school team. CIMI sponsored the girls in the summer coding camp to attend a volleyball camp twice a week. Volleyball taught me a lot, for example communicating, making friends, practicing my hits and throws in volleyball. This will help me to get on the volleyball team at my school faster and to do exercise. I don&rsquo;t have a favorite part in beach volleyball and normal volleyball, they were all fun to do. Thanks to CIMI for putting us in a volley bootcamps. We had fun all together and had memories and made new friends. -Fernanda I love sports and I always want to try new ones whenever I can.

Following our 10th Annual Adopt-A-Family celebration last December 2023, we hosted a series of events for our CIMI community. In the Spring, we held our annual Kick Off celebration to welcome and greet new families to our program. In the summer, we hosted a Back-To-School event to prepare our youth towards a new school year. Then for the first time ever, this fall, we provided scholarships to deserving first-generation college students. These events were made possible by the support of our amazing donors who helped CIMI raise $40,000 in donations in 2023 and $21,000 so far in 2024.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style="color: #000000;">10th Annual Adopt-A-Family</span></h2>\n<p><span style="color: #666666;">December 18, 2023</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style="color: #000000;">Our 10th Annual Adopt-A-Family event was a huge success! The CIMI community and donarship gathered for a fun-filled afternoon complete with holiday festivities, delicious food and even a photobooth. As always, our signature event began with a walking activity around the track to reinforce our values of building physical strength through exercise and community. Our event ended with our donors adopting their families and providing them with holiday gift cards. We were very proud to see our members commemorate the activities of the year, but also to see their growth and confidence building. For the first time, CIMI moms and daughters each made a presentation to the audience naming reasons why they are proud to be CIMI members and ways that CIMI has helped them grow mentally and physically. Amongst the reasons mentioned, is learning the value of community that CIMI provides.

Thanks to four of our CIMI members who cooked various wonderful Mexican dishes such as pozole, tamales, champurrado, chicken mole, rice and beans, vegetarian burritos,&nbsp; and more. There are plenty of desserts, such as bunuelos with sugar, fruit, cheesecake, and homemade flan, and plenty of drinks like horchata, sodas, and coffee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="https://givebutter.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/AutLvV2nF2fq661onT2UMOqlwqOidEuYKmSRp6Gj.png" width="439" height="311" data-image-failed="false">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf8WN0gFfhRtgUaork5bFl8rom_l8H8dDM5JIwYdN9XfD6kDVVdWsuV1xKIbwHvkj9TXZiLrQQguMkNkV8h25Vz1N86JTa3BybChpBkevf4BxbUPkX0127h7hnCDF3WXS90W0tyEw?key=UaoQcu66aHqvJ8YHBFqnCFq-" width="214" height="313" data-image-failed="false"></p>\n<p>CIMI member Tania Guerrero was in charge of the decorating committee and did an excellent job creating a fun holiday-themed event, including a photo booth.

ADOPT-A-FAMILY EVENT We are energized to report that we held another successful Adopt-a-Family event at the Campbell Community Center in December. We helped 50 families with 232 individual members. As always, we started the day with a walk before the event to get our energy going.
