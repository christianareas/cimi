			"2019 CIMI PROGRAMS Benevity Donations Fund CIMI Programs In 2019, CIMI received a total donation of $6,957.82 through Benevity. This allowed us to serve 190 members from 38 families in San Jose, California. Large portion of the funds ($4,000) was donated to the Washington School PTA in April 2019. Significant percentage of students at Washington School qualify for free or reduced-price meals and other programs designed to serve low income students. Coding and Robotics Workshop CIMI sponsored and hosted a series of half-day Coding and Robotics Workshop for middle school girls. The girls built robots using the kits from VEX IQ. These kits are designed to provide girls with fun, engaging, and hands-on experience of building robots from scratch. It naturally encourages teamwork, problem solving, and leadership while they learn about science, technology, engineering, and math. The girls learned under the tutelage of Silicon Valley tech workers who volunteered over several weekends. These volunteers from diverse backgrounds also served as a bright beacon for these girls who ordinarily do not interact with technology professionals. The workshops served as a catalyst to encourage girls to learn about and pursue studies in technology. At the end of the workshop one girl said, “At first I really did not want to learn anything about technology, but now I know technology is fun to do. Thanks to CIMI, I like technology.” Help Expand Coding and Robotics Program in 2020 We will be able to expand the Coding and Robotics Workshop in 2020 with your donation. This year, 10 girls participated in the Coding and Robotics Workshop over five weekends in August, October, and November. Next year, we would like to offer this workshop on a regular schedule by securing a space and hiring a tutor. Walk/Run From May through November, girls and their mothers gathered at the Brenda Lopez Plaza in San Jose to walk at 7:00 a.m. Having an exercise buddy builds accountability towards fitness goal. This program is designed to encourage girls and their mothers to begin regular exercise. About 30 families have been participating in this for the last three years. They have progressed from no exercise to regular exercise! We look forward to the participants increasing their fitness to begin running. Back to School Drive CIMI hosted a Back to School Drive for students in the San Jose area. Backpacks donated by Silicon Valley Education Foundation were filled with essential school supplies such as pens, highlighters, calculators, and more. Volunteers stuffed the backpacks for the students and also prepared special duffle bags for the teachers. Teachers often spend their own money on classroom supplies. These duffle bags consisted of copy papers, scissors, Clorox wipes, and binders. Students delighted in presenting the duffle bags to their favorite teachers. Your donation will allow us to serve more students and teachers next year.

Socorro was a homemaker with no experience in sewing, but she quickly learned how to make different types of masks with the help from a CIMI volunteer and Internet resources. So far she has made 180 masks and sells them for $5 each. She uses half of the money to restock on supplies to make new masks. If you&rsquo;re inclined, you can support Socorro and her family by buying her masks for $5 each.",

The COVID-19 pandemic made the lives of the underserved families, who were already struggling to make ends meet, very difficult. The service jobs disappeared as restaurants shut down. Children lacking technology access and parental guidance for their school work struggled with distance learning. The sponsors for the Family Sponsor Drive met the challenge by going above and beyond last year&rsquo;s generous gift.</p>\n<p>The socially-distanced gift presentation event took place on the mornings of December 17 and 19 at the Brenda Lopez Memorial Plaza in San Jose, California. CIMI organized this event to make the gift presentation interaction as safe as possible for the families and the volunteers. The families were scheduled to drive by the pick-up site in 15-minute increments. The sponsors and volunteers wearing masks and face shields handed the gifts through the car window. Hand sanitizers were used after each interaction.</p>\n<h2><strong>A Glimpse into the Life of a Sponsored Family</strong></h2>\n<p>One of Paty&rsquo;s daughters attended CIMI&rsquo;s Coding and Robotics program one year ago. The instructors and CIMI volunteers could see that she had talent for coding. Her thirst for knowledge was fueled by her mother, Paty. Paty believes that that only way to get out of the hole is education. A few years ago, she was interviewed by a local newspaper that was writing an inspirational story of how a mother in an underserved community managed to keep the family together and held the children to high academic standards. It is a big task for a mother of eight children, where one daughter attends Santa Clara University on full scholarship and another daughter attends Notre Dame High School, a private school, also on full scholarship. Other children in elementary and middle schools have excellent grades. Having all eight children excel in their studies is a huge accomplishment for Paty, but it comes with struggles behind the scenes. Paty&rsquo;s daughter Maria did not have a computer to use for her classes so the school provided her with an old one. The school computer was slow and her classmates were complaining that she was taking too long. Maria cried and told her mother of her difficulties. Paty begged her husband to buy a new computer for their daughter. He said, &ldquo;No, there is no money.&rdquo; Then Paty went to her brother and convinced him to buy a computer on credit. This allowed Maria to be efficient in her assignments and keep up with her classmates. In December 2020, Paty received gift cards from CIMI&rsquo;s Sponsor a Family Holiday Drive. This allowed her to buy the much-needed computer accessories such as computer charger and headphones for her children. Other families sponsored by CIMI have their own stories. We are grateful for the generous sponsors and donors who made a difficult Christmas during a pandemic just a bit brighter for these families.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>CIMI raised a total of <strong>$70,000</strong> through this drive, of which $33,000 was used for this event. The number of families participating in CIMI programs has grown over the years due to the generosity of our donors. 55 families representing 236 members received Visa, Target, or Home Depot gift cards during this event. CIMI volunteers organized the gift purchases and connected the sponsors with the families. The balance of $37,000 will be used to fund the CIMI Coding/Robotics, Run/Walk and Sponsor a Family programs in 2021.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The number of families participating in CIMI programs has grown over the years due to the generosity of our donors. A majority of the sponsored families participated in the CIMI programs in 2020: 80% of them participated in the Run/Walk program with their entire family for health and fitness; and 10% of them participated in the Tutoring program to help the children with distance learning.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In past years, prior to the COVID crisis, CIMI has held a luncheon and party for the sponsors and families at the Campbell Community Center to present gifts to the families. The sponsors and families got to interact with each other as they shared a wonderfully prepared meal by the families. We look forward to when we can have such a party again! We thank all our volunteers for helping to make this year&rsquo;s Sponsor a Family drive by such a huge success.</p>\n<p><img src="https://givebutter.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/VU7RLqn7bIocS4mMxZ8P5RpDBqXAJVS58nhkCBEz.jpg" width="713" height="534"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class="gallery"><img src="https://givebutter.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/Cd58W4JpDRbb6G0jjYVSnpl482GTiIcdaqaooO3U.png" width="495" height="660"><img src="https://givebutter.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/vn4oB4LTOYVL2S8UFj2baTPyFfrhvy4jGVjJVXnf.jpg" width="497" height="662" data-image-failed="false"></div>\n<div class="gallery">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class="gallery">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class="gallery">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class="gallery"><img src="https://givebutter.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/K1LArM09OtHBvVkBRGiPtjfzzDvDk8GG1Axx6591.jpg" width="778" height="583"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>CIMI also helped 10 families in San Juan del Sur in Nicaragua this year.

Paty begged her husband to buy a new computer for their daughter. He said, &ldquo;No, there is no money.&rdquo; Then Paty went to her brother and convinced him to buy a computer on credit. This allowed Maria to be efficient in her assignments and keep up with her classmates. In December 2020, Paty received gift cards from CIMI&rsquo;s Sponsor a Family Holiday Drive. This allowed her to buy the much-needed computer accessories such as computer charger and headphones for her children. Other families sponsored by CIMI have their own stories. We are grateful for the generous sponsors and donors who made a difficult Christmas during a pandemic just a bit brighter for these families. CIMI raised a total of $70,000 through this drive, of which $33,000 was used for this event. The number of families participating in CIMI programs has grown over the years due to the generosity of our donors. 55 families representing 236 members received Visa, Target, or Home Depot gift cards during this event. CIMI volunteers organized the gift purchases and connected the sponsors with the families. The balance of $37,000 will be used to fund the CIMI Coding/Robotics, Run/Walk and Sponsor a Family programs in 2021. The number of families participating in CIMI programs has grown over the years due to the generosity of our donors. A majority of the sponsored families participated in the CIMI programs in 2020: 80% of them participated in the Run/Walk program with their entire family for health and fitness; and 10% of them participated in the Tutoring program to help the children with distance learning. In past years, prior to the COVID crisis, CIMI has held a luncheon and party for the sponsors and families at the Campbell Community Center to present gifts to the families. The sponsors and families got to interact with each other as they shared a wonderfully prepared meal by the families. We look forward to when we can have such a party again! We thank all our volunteers for helping to make this year&rsquo;s Sponsor a Family drive by such a huge success. CIMI also helped 10 families in San Juan del Sur in Nicaragua this year. These impoverished families suffered water damages in November 2020 when two category 4 hurricanes, Eta and Iota, made landfall in Central America. CIMI provided basic supplies and food to these families. This woman in pink coordinated the distribution of food and supplies to these families. I want to give infinite thanks to Sherry for sponsoring us in these difficult times, may God fill everyone in her family with health. I have no words to thank for how much she did for my family and me, I feel blessed and very grateful for everything. THANK YOU. -Joaquina Merry Christmas to you and your entire team at CIMI. My family and I would like to thank and wish Merry Christmas to the donors who sponsored us. It was a great help. Although I have not yet been able to buy gifts for my daughters, I am very grateful for everything you have done for all the families in the community. I could not thank you for everything because I felt very bad. I did not want anything because I got COVID-19, but thankfully I got over it and I am better. A thousand thanks for the help from CIMI. May you have happy holidays. -Villica&ntilde;a Family I hope you are well and that this Christmas you had a good time. I want to thank the person who chose me this Christmas. My family and I had a Christmas dinner and my children had a gift. God bless this lady who has such a big heart that she will always be in my prayers. On behalf of Madrigal family, a thousand thousand thanks! -Soccoro Hello CIMI, this year was so difficult not only for me or my family, but I think it was difficult for everybody. At least in my family we had a very very wonderful help and support during this time. CIMI became part of my family and that is something for which I will always be grateful. Thanks to the generosity of Mrs. Peggy, my kids enjoyed Christmas. I bought them their toys, one scooter to each one of them. We have a lot to celebrate because we have clothes, shoes, and a wonderful and delicious dinner for Christmas. For a moment my family forgot the pandemic and the money problems we had. We used part of the help we received to pay some bills. Thank you to CIMI for making this possible. We continue walking and enjoying the time we spent together. Thank you. -Rosario Thank you Sponsors!",

She likes to draw a lot, especially figures of human faces and anime characters. The set to make bracelets and necklaces was also one of her favorites.</em></p>\n<p><em>Me and my husband did not expect so many gift cards. With the cards we bought things that we needed for the kitchen for our home, I also bought some nice clothes for me. My husband bought special shoes for construction since the ones he had were very worn and needed new ones.

			"Adopt A Family 2021 Celebration of the Holiday Spirit! December 30, 2021 It was a great pleasure to share the giving spirit over homemade food as CIMI families and sponsors gathered outdoors on Saturday December 18, 2021 for their annual Adopt a Family holiday event. This year 36 families received holiday gifts totaling $26,000 from the sponsors. Volunteers carefully organized the event of over 100 people at Santa Maria Urban Ministries in San Jose California to ensure the safety of all participants &ndash; vaccination, masking, and social distancing. We are grateful for the team of CIMI family moms, volunteers, board members, and the sponsors for their careful attention to details for making this a successful event. Our Outdoor Venue Organized with Safety in Mind Delicious Food Made with Love Being a Filipino, Christmas is very special to my heart. It is the time to appreciate what you have, share your blessings, and spend quality time with family. This year, I am far away from home, but I am keeping the Christmas spirit alive by supporting these wonderful ladies I treat as \"Ate's\" - which stands for older sisters in Tagalog. I am grateful for the love and the feeling of having a family, especially during these times when I am away from home. - Kamille Matias, CIMI Board Member Sponsors Present Gifts to Families Once again I am convinced that good and generous people still exist. Thanks to Terry, Mrs. Claudia and all the team that made it possible for me and my whole family to receive gifts at Christmas. As I have said before, a smile on the face of my children is the most wonderful thing a parent can see, and it is in that moment that we realize that all work and sacrifice is worth it. Thank you very much for all the gifts you gave us, it was just what my children wanted. 3-year-old Julian was fascinated with his monster trucks. 6-year-old Jimena was delighted by the unicorn monster truck, and remote control car (now she can play with Julian), the scooter, and especially the princess dress as she said. 12-year-old Fernanda did not expect everything you gave her. She likes to draw a lot, especially figures of human faces and anime characters. The set to make bracelets and necklaces was also one of her favorites. Me and my husband did not expect so many gift cards. With the cards we bought things that we needed for the kitchen for our home, I also bought some nice clothes for me. My husband bought special shoes for construction since the ones he had were very worn and needed new ones. I hope in the future I can give back to the CIMI program and help the families that are part of CIMI. To be honest, I consider that more than a program we are already a family because we all know each other, we support each other when we have a problem and we motivate each other to move forward, but also very important is all the help that CIMI has given us during the most difficult moments. Thank you, God bless you. -Leyva-Jimenez's Family Ivonne, thank you for leading the families to go on a 2k walk before the party. I appreciate your contribution and the great energy you bring to us. Maya, thank you for all the hours you put into this event to make it a success. Organizing a team to buy the gift cards and preparing them was a huge help. Kamille, thank you for preparing the Christmas Cards, the long hours of baking at your house, and donating items. Judith and Jennifer, I really appreciate your support for this program and your donations. With gratitude, Aracely Areas CIMI Founder",

Thanks to CIMI I was able to learn more, get feedback on my performance, and get used to it again. I learned how to spike and do the overhand serve. It was hard at first but I kept trying. What I enjoyed the most was the activities we did during beach and indoor volleyball because we combined everything we learned and put it to the test. Also we were able to see how the professionals play it. Thanks to these volleyball classes I was able to remember the moves I used to do.

Maybe someday I could also have a job thanks to it.</em> <strong>-Kiara Garcia</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Good afternoon my name is Fernanda and I&rsquo;m one of the girls that are in coding classes.&nbsp;</em><em>We started with 13 girls at the beginning of the first module. Since there were a lot of us at the time, we helped each other and built a robot at the end of the first module .&nbsp; </em><em>There were 7 girls left at the second module. Again we helped each other finish the second module.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>The third module didn&rsquo;t have as many girls in the beginning, but we still worked hard and had fun together. There were 5 girls and I was one of them. It took me a while to understand the third module (swift), but with some teamwork we finished our last module. Coding was a bit hard and when I started the third module. I kept getting behind everyone and I always got confused, but with some help from my classmates and teachers I got an idea of how it works but I still have problems typing the code to make the character move.</em></p>\n<p><em>T</em><em>hank you CIMI for providing coding classes for us. I appreciate all the teachers &ndash; Ms.Brenda, Ms.Ivonne, and Josh. They have helped me a lot. </em><strong>-Fernanda</strong></p>\n<p><em>Coding Experience</em></p>\n<p><em>At the beginning I did not know anything about coding &ndash; how it worked, why it worked that way, and the structure it is coded in. But when I started coding I started to learn different things like getting to know how the computer works and its language. </em></p>\n<p><em>I made some mistakes on the way but when I analyzed it I was able to figure it out, sometimes it was because I spelled something wrong or because I missed a part of code or put the wrong word of code.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>Scratch was easy but when we started with Swift I felt that the real challenge had come. And I was right. But, with every class I learned new things and how they worked. We even made our own virtual assistant app. That was another challenge because we had to change the code we had already done and add new things or replace some parts of the code.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>Overall I loved coding because I was able to make some code and test how it might work if someone was actually using it. Now that I will be entering 8th grade it might come in handy to use my coding for some classes I have at my school. Like Game design, robotics, and multimedia and in these classes some code is needed.&nbsp;</em><strong>-Amy</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Hydraulic Claw Project</em></p>\n<p><em>This project is made for plumbing water through multiple tubes all ink at once. In real life this is called a control panel. There are many different ways but I chose the water one. This robot is connected to things that go way back in the past to be used in the future. From this, I learned never to give up. It really challenged me to not give up because at first I had no idea what this was. I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t because this turned out amazing and I learned a new robot. I\'m happy to show off my new robot to the world!</em> <strong>-Perla Leon</strong></p>\n<p><em>Project Experience (Desktop Cork Board)</em></p>\n<p><em>Today, each of us got our own kit at random. We had around 2 hours to build it. I got the kit to make a desktop cork board.</em></p>\n<p><em>I used washi tape, paint, brushes, wood easel, wood stand, wood push pins, word balloon notes, masking stickers, fabric strip, cork piece, sticky foam, and tape hinge. </em></p>\n<p><em>The first steps were easy like putting the tape to make the design, painting, painting the wood push pins even though I poked myself. The trickiest part was putting the wood easel and the wood stand together because I had to put half of the tape hinge on the wood stand. It took me a while to figure it out but I figured out how to do it by using the line that divided the tape hinge. Later it was to put the sticky foam on the other end of the fabric piece after it was put through the hole.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>At the end it came out good. I did my own design of paint and worked on it by myself. This cork board will help me to remind me of the events coming up. I learned that some things are harder than the others and that not everything will come out on the first try. Also I learned how to use a cork board to help me remind me of things and how to build the structure of the cork board with a few simple materials.</em> <strong>-Amy</strong></p>\n<h2>Computer Training for Moms</h2>\n<p>Once a month, while the girls met in person at the Camden Community Center to work on their assignments, their moms got to learn basic computer skills.</p>\n<p>For those who work in the tech industry, it&rsquo;s easy to forget that basic computer skills can be an impediment to those who did not grow up with technology. The basic computer skills were taught in a friendly, hands-on session led by a CIMI board member Kamille.</p>\n<p>Moms also participated on a morning walk and learned injury prevention tips from our board Member president Aracely.</p>\n<p>Huge &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; to our Volunteers: Rosario Jiminez, Paty Lozano, Tania Brito, Janeth Garcia and Maria Villicana. They are our core volunteers, helping organize all CIMI events.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what the moms said:</p>\n<p><em>Today I had my first computer class, and I learned how to create a new email account, how to add my emails to my contacts and how to learn and turn off a computer. thanks for the class. </em><strong>-Janeth Garcia</strong></p>\n<p><em>Hey! I learned how to use the computer. I learned how to turn off a computer, how to program my calendar, how to create new emails and how to add new contacts.</em></p>\n<p><em>Today I learned how to have a better posture and I also learned how to write and put dates, days, and miles walked per week on Strava and send to Rosario and how you use google doc thanks to Camille for teaching us this is something new for me I hope to learn more thanks.&nbsp;</em><em><strong>-</strong></em><strong>Maria Villicana</strong></p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em>Today on this beautiful day I learned many wonderful things.!!!

Following our 10th Annual Adopt-A-Family celebration last December 2023, we hosted a series of events for our CIMI community. In the Spring, we held our annual Kick Off celebration to welcome and greet new families to our program. In the summer, we hosted a Back-To-School event to prepare our youth towards a new school year. Then for the first time ever, this fall, we provided scholarships to deserving first-generation college students. These events were made possible by the support of our amazing donors who helped CIMI raise $40,000 in donations in 2023 and $21,000 so far in 2024.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style="color: #000000;">10th Annual Adopt-A-Family</span></h2>\n<p><span style="color: #666666;">December 18, 2023</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style="color: #000000;">Our 10th Annual Adopt-A-Family event was a huge success! The CIMI community and donarship gathered for a fun-filled afternoon complete with holiday festivities, delicious food and even a photobooth. As always, our signature event began with a walking activity around the track to reinforce our values of building physical strength through exercise and community. Our event ended with our donors adopting their families and providing them with holiday gift cards. We were very proud to see our members commemorate the activities of the year, but also to see their growth and confidence building. For the first time, CIMI moms and daughters each made a presentation to the audience naming reasons why they are proud to be CIMI members and ways that CIMI has helped them grow mentally and physically. Amongst the reasons mentioned, is learning the value of community that CIMI provides.

To start, our amazing CIMI Moms (Rosario, Tania, Janeth, and Maria V.) arrived at 6:45 am to prepare the space, lay out breakfast items, and to decorate with our signature CIMI flags. Thirty-one families arrived shortly after and began the morning with a walk around the neighborhood.

While we expected entries from younger scholars, our first recipient spoke about attending college online while being in her late thirties and as a mother of three. She takes online classes in the evenings and shared how challenging it is to juggle motherhood and school.

			"CIMI 2024: A Year in Review November 2024 This year has been an exciting and productive year for our team at CIMI. Following our 10th Annual Adopt-A-Family celebration last December 2023, we hosted a series of events for our CIMI community. In the Spring, we held our annual Kick Off celebration to welcome and greet new families to our program. In the summer, we hosted a Back-To-School event to prepare our youth towards a new school year. Then for the first time ever, this fall, we provided scholarships to deserving first-generation college students. These events were made possible by the support of our amazing donors who helped CIMI raise $40,000 in donations in 2023 and $21,000 so far in 2024. 10th Annual Adopt-A-Family December 18, 2023 Our 10th Annual Adopt-A-Family event was a huge success! The CIMI community and donarship gathered for a fun-filled afternoon complete with holiday festivities, delicious food and even a photobooth. As always, our signature event began with a walking activity around the track to reinforce our values of building physical strength through exercise and community. Our event ended with our donors adopting their families and providing them with holiday gift cards. We were very proud to see our members commemorate the activities of the year, but also to see their growth and confidence building. For the first time, CIMI moms and daughters each made a presentation to the audience naming reasons why they are proud to be CIMI members and ways that CIMI has helped them grow mentally and physically. Amongst the reasons mentioned, is learning the value of community that CIMI provides. Scroll through the carousel below to view more pictures from the event. 2024 Annual Kick-Off Celebration April 6, 2024 We rang in the new year with our kick-off gathering hosted at Santa Maria Urban Ministry. After the holidays, is a great time for us to reconnect with our families and to remind ourselves of our CIMI values complete with pan y cafecito. To start, our amazing CIMI Moms (Rosario, Tania, Janeth, and Maria V.) arrived at 6:45 am to prepare the space, lay out breakfast items, and to decorate with our signature CIMI flags. Thirty-one families arrived shortly after and began the morning with a walk around the neighborhood. Following the walk, our CIMI founder, Aracely Areas, welcomed members old and new to share information about the upcoming events for the year. CIMI also provided gift cards which were much appreciated. Everyone was excited to kick off 2024! Back-to-School September 10, 2024 Our back-to-school event was held at Santa Maria Urban Ministry. Prior to the event, volunteers gathered to put together school supplies for the participating families. Also included were school uniforms. On the day of the event, the families met at 7:00 am for a 1.5 mile morning walk. Following the walk, the CIMI team welcomed families with morning coffee and breakfast items for the adults and kids. Afterwards, 39 families received back-to school bags for the upcoming school year. All the families were grateful for the support they received that day. Scholarship Awarding Ceremony October 6, 2024 A new initiative this year was to offer scholarships to college students. For the first time in CIMI history, we awarded three college students with scholarships and hosted an award ceremony! CIMI volunteers prepared a delicious lunch of carne asada and chicken tacos with side dishes. We also hosted a raffle for all the CIMI members to participate. Raffle prizes included Amazon gift cards, Chevron gift cards and backpacks. CIMI received three applications and we were so impressed with the caliber of the students that we decided to award all three applicants. While we expected entries from younger scholars, our first recipient spoke about attending college online while being in her late thirties and as a mother of three. She takes online classes in the evenings and shared how challenging it is to juggle motherhood and school. She said she knows this is the best path for her future as a social worker, and was awarded $1500. Our second recipient also received $1500 to attend college. She is a first generation college student, originally from Mexico, and is pursuing an education and degree in Nursing. Finally, our third honoree had once been part of our Girls-Who-Code program and earned the largest scholarship amount: $2000. She discussed her plans of majoring in criminology. Our three scholarship winners What&rsquo;s Next Our year in review has been eventful for our CIMI community.
