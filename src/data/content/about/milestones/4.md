## CIMI started an initiative to provide technology to girls in need.

In partnership with the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, CIMI created the Design_Code_Bootcamp at the Computer History Museum to provide girls in grades 6 through 8 with an opportunity to participate in engaging, hands-on STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, math) workshops.
