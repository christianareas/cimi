Volunteers provide foundational support for CIMI programs and are essential to expanding the number of opportunities offered to local families. 
CIMI volunteers help with events, tutor girls in middle and high school, teach girls how to code, coach running and walking training, and share their expertise by teaching classes. CIMI truly could not operate without the support of dedicated volunteers.
