As a 503(c) non-profit organization, CIMI relies on financial support from donors like you. All gifts are put into an unrestricted fund, allowing CIMI to use them for operational expenses like robotics supplies, running shoes, and tutoring materials. It also allows CIMIâ€™s operations to evolve with the needs of the community. For example, we may give money to local families in need during the holidays, purchase school supplies for local classrooms, or provide gas cards to low-income parents involved in CIMI.
